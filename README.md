# Youpers Backend Platform


## API Documentation

The API documentation is autogenerated and provided as a Website using tooling from  [swagger](https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/).

### Prerequisites:
- you have your local backend running at localhost:8000

### Installation
In order to display the documentation from the locally running Backend during development follow these steps:

- clone this github repo: https://github.com/YouPers/swagger-ui.git
- cd swagger-ui
- npm install
- node web.js
- open your preferred browser and go to localhost:5000 and enjoy the API documenation.

In order to see the API documentation of a deployed instance of the backend, you can either use your local swagger-ui (see
above) and just enter the backend-URL in the input-box on top. Or you can use a public swagger site like:
[swagger public](http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/) and enter the YouPers Backend-URL into the input box on
top e.g. https://uat.youpers.com/api-docs
